<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## What's Inside?

I made this project in order to improve my knowledge with Javascript, and also get to know Tailwind CSS.
I worked with a fixed database json file, which lists all the cars listed for sale in the main page.

The website has a login system that allows you to create, edit and delete your posts by a admin page where you put all the needed info to put a vehicle for sale. It also has a page for all the cars listed to give you more information about any car in the website.

With this project I got to know better the CSS framework and i also learned a lot of JS new features by creating all the functionalities of the website.
